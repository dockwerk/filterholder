***********************************************************
Filter-holders for Leitz Focomat Ic and Valloy II enlargers
***********************************************************

This project contains basic CAD drawings and specifications
to manufacture under the lens filter holders for the
following Leitz enlargers:

* Focomat Ic
* Valloy II

All filter holder designs are inspired by the hard to find
Leitz USA filter holder for Ic, part Nr. 17636 from the
1970 Leitz USA catalog. The stock red filter as well as
Beseler and Omega filter holders were used as inspiration
for a suitable design.

All rights reserved. At the moment this project is
proprietary. You may use the plans to make your own holder
for your private use. It is not allowed to sell holders
you make from this plans. 

A more liberal license will be determined soon.

We're looking for contributions:

  * Protoype manufacturing (laser milling) to verify designs
  * 3D drawing suitable for 3D milling

=============================
Specifications for Focomat Ic
=============================

--------------
Main workpiece
--------------
Material:
  * Steel 1.5mm

Finish:
  * chrome plating, mat black (not: chromate conversion coating)
  * wrinkle paint, black (like 17636)

Mounting:
  * combination of a M6 shoulder with compression spring acting as
    distance sleeve and fixing position.



-------------------------------------
DIN 923 shoulder screw specifications
-------------------------------------
By choosing different lengths of the shoulder screw, various lens-holder
distances can be realized. The following specifications provide the closest
approximation to the 17636 holder.


+------------------------+----------+
| Thread                 | M6       |
+------------------------+----------+
| Diameter (head)        | 13mm     |
+------------------------+----------+
| Diameter (shoulder)    | 8mm      |
+------------------------+----------+
| Length (shoulder)      | 10mm     |
+------------------------+----------+
| Length (thread)        | 9mm      |
+------------------------+----------+


---------------------------------
Compression spring specifications
---------------------------------

+------------------------+----------------------+
| Type                   | compression, V2A     |
+------------------------+----------------------+
| Ends                   | angelegt+geschliffen |
+------------------------+----------------------+
| Wire diameter          | 1mm                  |
+------------------------+----------------------+
| Spine diameter         | 8mm                  |
+------------------------+----------------------+
| Mininum length         | 10mm                 |
+------------------------+----------------------+
| Maximum length         | tbd                  |
+------------------------+----------------------+
| Nominal length         | tbd                  |
+------------------------+----------------------+

We ordered the following product to experiment
with: Gutekunst `VD-151B`_ and finialize the specifications.


===========================
Specifications for Valoy II
===========================

This holder differs only in the use of a slotted hole instead of a
round one. Therefore the holder can be mounted on the adjustable
L-bracket which comes with the red filter of the Valoy II.




==========================================
Specification of the original 17636 holder
==========================================

All specs are measured with common tools and might not be 100% accurate.
